## What This Guide Is

Fable 5 is the most capable AI model ever made publicly available. It posted #1 on finance benchmarks, broke 90% on complex analytics tasks, and is 20% more accurate on document QA than the prior best model. But knowing what a model can do and knowing how to actually use it are different things.

This guide is for data analysts, business analysts, and anyone working with data who wants to use Fable 5 effectively from day one.

## When to Use Fable 5 vs. Other Models

Use **Fable 5** when:
- The task is complex and multi-stage (deep research, document synthesis, financial modeling)
- You're working across long documents with charts, tables, embedded data
- You need the model to self-verify and catch its own errors
- The task runs over multiple hours or requires autonomous execution
- The quality gap matters more than speed or cost

Use **Opus 4.8** (half the price) when:
- Tasks are shorter and well-defined
- Cost efficiency matters more than top accuracy
- You're running high volume, lower-complexity queries

Use **Sonnet 4.6** when:
- Speed is the priority
- Tasks are conversational or iterative
- You're doing quick lookups, summaries, or simple rewrites

**Rule of thumb:** Fable 5 for the hardest 20% of your work, Sonnet/Opus for the rest.

## Use Case Playbook

### 1. Earnings Report Analysis

**What Fable 5 can do:** Ingest a full earnings report PDF (with embedded charts and tables), extract key metrics, compare against prior quarters, flag inconsistencies between CEO commentary and underlying financials, and produce a structured analyst note.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
You are a senior financial analyst. Analyze the attached Q2 2026 earnings report for [Company].

Extract:
1. Revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income — with QoQ and YoY % change
2. Any notable guidance revisions (raise, lower, or maintain)
3. Key risk factors mentioned in the MD&A
4. Differences between management commentary and the numbers

Present findings in analyst note format: Executive Summary → Key Metrics → Risk Factors → Guidance → Assessment.
```

**Why Fable 5 specifically:** Its document vision handles embedded charts and tables in PDFs accurately. Its financial reasoning benchmarks (#1 on Hebbia Finance) are built for exactly this.

---

### 2. Multi-Source KPI Reporting

**What Fable 5 can do:** Pull together KPI data from multiple documents, reconcile discrepancies, and produce a clean weekly/monthly report — autonomous and consistent.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
I'm providing [n] data files covering [date range] for [business/store/department].

Build a KPI summary report that covers:
- Revenue trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Top and bottom performers
- Anomalies or outliers worth flagging
- Period-over-period comparisons

Format as an executive-ready report with a summary table first, then detailed breakdowns by category.
```

---

### 3. Document QA at Scale

**What Fable 5 can do:** Answer specific questions across large document sets — contracts, filings, SOPs, policy documents — without hallucinating references.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
You are reviewing the following documents: [attach files]

Answer each question below using direct evidence from the documents. 
For each answer, cite the specific section and page.
If the answer is not in the documents, say so explicitly.

Questions:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
...
```

**Key note:** Fable 5's accuracy on document QA (+20% over Opus 4.8) and its lower false-positive rate make it significantly more reliable for this than previous models.

### 4. Snowflake SQL + AI

**What Fable 5 can do directly in SQL:**

```sql
-- Summarize financial filings stored in a table
SELECT 
  company_name,
  filing_date,
  AI_COMPLETE(
    'claude-fable-5',
    PROMPT(
      'Review the following financial filing and summarize:
       1. Key revenue trends
       2. Margin changes QoQ
       3. Notable risk factors mentioned
       Filing: {0}',
      filing_text
    )
  ) AS ai_summary
FROM financial_filings
WHERE filing_date >= '2026-01-01';
```

```sql
-- Classify and tag customer feedback
SELECT 
  feedback_id,
  feedback_text,
  AI_COMPLETE(
    'claude-fable-5',
    PROMPT(
      'Classify this customer feedback into: [Product Issue, Service Issue, Pricing Concern, Positive Experience, Other].
       Return only the category name.
       Feedback: {0}',
      feedback_text
    )
  ) AS feedback_category
FROM customer_feedback;
```

---

### 5. Autonomous Research + Synthesis

**What Fable 5 can do:** Given a research topic or business question, it can autonomously search, pull data, synthesize findings across sources, and produce a structured deliverable — without step-by-step human direction.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
Research task: [Your topic / question]

Deliverable: [Format — e.g., competitive analysis, market overview, strategic brief]

Depth required: [e.g., executive summary only / detailed with data / full report with sources]

Key questions to answer:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]

Do not ask for clarification. Make reasonable assumptions and flag them at the end.
```

## Working Patterns for Analysts

### Use Claude Code for Data Work
If you have Claude Max or an Enterprise plan, Claude Code integrates Fable 5 for agentic data tasks — writing and executing Python/SQL, running analysis on your local files, producing reports from your own data.

### Prompt Caching = Cost Control
If you have a stable system prompt (your company's reporting template, data schema, analytical framework), put it in a cached prefix. 90% input token discount on cached content dramatically reduces per-run cost on Fable 5.

### Verification Prompts
Fable 5 self-verifies, but you can make it explicit:
```
After completing the analysis:
1. Check all numbers against the source documents
2. Flag any calculations you're uncertain about
3. Note any data that was ambiguous or required assumptions
```

### Batch Similar Tasks
The 1M context window means you can batch similar tasks in one session — e.g., analyze 10 store locations' monthly reports simultaneously rather than running 10 separate sessions.

## Cost Math for Analysts

| Task | Estimated Tokens | Fable 5 Cost | Opus 4.8 Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single earnings report analysis | 50K in / 5K out | ~$0.75 | ~$0.38 |
| 10-document research synthesis | 200K in / 15K out | ~$2.75 | ~$1.38 |
| Monthly KPI report (cached schema) | 500K in / 20K out → ~$0.05 in (cached) + $1 out | ~$1.05 | ~$0.53 |
| Full codebase/data audit | 500K in / 50K out | ~$7.50 | ~$3.75 |

**Rule:** When accuracy matters more than speed and the task is complex enough to justify the quality premium, Fable 5 pays for itself in analyst time saved.

## What Fable 5 Can't Do (Yet)

- **Real-time data:** No live database or API connections by default — you bring the data to it
- **Cybersecurity queries:** Automatically routed to Opus 4.8
- **Faster than Opus 4.8:** Databricks noted Fable 5 is ~30% slower — not the model for latency-sensitive applications
- **Every session is fresh:** No memory across sessions by default (build prompts to include relevant context)
